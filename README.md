# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Solution-using-Simulated-Annealing
This document outlines our approach to solving the CVRP using Simulated Annealing (SA), a powerful metaheuristic optimization technique. We present the problem formulation, solution methodology, implementation details, and results analysis.
